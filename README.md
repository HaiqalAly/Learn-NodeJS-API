### 🚀 NodeJS Express MongoDB CRUD API

This project is a simple, foundational RESTful API built with Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a Product resource. 
This is my starting point for learning backend API development.

> Note: This is my very first attempt at building a backend API and is intended strictly for learning and demonstrating core CRUD functionality.
> As a result, some production-level practices might have been simplified or omitted.

## ✨ Features
- RESTful Routing: Clear, predictable routes defined under `/api/products` for all CRUD operations
- Express Middleware: Configured to handle incoming JSON data `(req.body)`
- MongoDB Integration: Uses Mongoose for object data modeling (ODM) and secure connectivity
- Separation of Concerns: Organized code with dedicated files for Routes, Controllers, and the main server logic
- Environment Variables: Secure connection to the MongoDB Atlas using the dotenv package
- Development Workflow: Uses nodemon for automatic server restarts during development

## 🏁 Getting Started
Prerequisites: You need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

### 1. Installation
```bash
# Cloning the repository
git clone https://github.com/HaiqalAly/Learn-CRUD-NodeAPI

# Navigate to folder
cd Learn-CRUD-NodeAPI

# Install Dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environtment Variable<br>
Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project and add your MongoDB connection string.<br>
Inside the `.env` write:

```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

> Note: Replace the placeholders with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection details.

### 3. Run the Server (Dev)
Start the application using the development script defined in the `package.json`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command uses nodemon, which will watch for file changes and automatically restart the server.

The server will be running at http://localhost:3000. You will see the following confirmation in your console:

```bash
Connected to MongoDB
Example app listening on port 3000
```
